Before a cell becomes specialised, it first starts out as a stem cell. The unique feature of stem cells is that they are pluripotent - they have the potential to become any type of cell in the body. These incredible cells are the ancestors of all cells in the body, from simple skin cells to complex neurons. Without these cells, we wouldn't be as complex or functional as human beings.

Not only this, these “magic” cells even have the power to replicate into healthy cells in order to speed up regeneration after certain pathological conditions. The process that allows stem cells to transform into any kind of cell is known as cell differentiation and is controlled by a combination of internal genetics and external factors such as chemicals and physical contact with other cells. Stem cells have the ability to divide and replicate themselves for long periods of time.

There are two types of stem cells, embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. Embryonic stem cells are from embryos. Generally used in a research setting, embryonic stem cells are harvested from fertilised eggs. Adult (or somatic) stem cells are present throughout the human body [amongst other specialised tissue cells]. They exist in order to repair and maintain surrounding specialised tissues.

As these cells are unspecialised, stem cell anatomy is that of a simple cell. Stem cells have a cell membrane, surrounding the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm contains a nucleus, mitochondria, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, lysosomes and centrioles. The nucleus contains DNA and RNA, which are expressed when differentiation occurs in the cell.
Red blood cells

Erythrocyte (Erythrocytus); Image: 
Erythrocyte (Erythrocytus)
Red blood cells are known as erythrocytes, and are the most common type of blood cell. They are shaped like a biconcave disc (I.e. donut shaped). They have a diameter of around 6 to 8 µm and have an average thickness of 2 µm, being 2.5 µm thick at their thickest point and 1 µm thick at the center. Red blood cells are fairly flexible, allowing them to squeeze through thin blood capillaries.

The  main role of red blood cells is to transport oxygen around the body using haemoglobin. However, they also help to control pH of the blood by forming an acid-base buffer maintaining the blood at a neutral pH of 7.35 to 7.45. They also release an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase, which causes water in the blood to carry carbon dioxide to the lungs, so that it can be expelled from the body.

Haemoglobin is a molecule in red blood cells that binds to oxygen, allowing it to be transported through the blood. Haemoglobin is comprised of a heme molecule and a globin molecule. Heme molecules are formed from succinyl-CoA and glycine. Four of these molecules together bind with iron forming a heme  molecule. This combines with a globin polypeptide chain forming a haemoglobin chain (also named globulin chain). Four of these chains together create a haemoglobin molecule. There are four different types of haemoglobin chains; alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The most common combination is two alpha chains and two beta chains, which form a haemoglobin A molecule.

Skin cells

There are many different types of cells in the epidermis (top layer) of the skin. The epidermis contains the following cell types:

Keratinocytes (Keratinocyti); Image: 
Keratinocytes (Keratinocyti)
Keratinocytes: These cells make up 95% of the epidermis and are sometimes known as basal cells, as they are found in the basal layer of the epidermis. Keratinocytes generate the protein keratin, but are also important in protecting the body by blocking toxins and pathogens, and preventing loss of heat and moisture. They also stimulate inflammation and secrete inhibitory cytokines. The outermost layer of epidermis is formed by keratinized epithelial cells which are responsible for forming the protective barrier. Hair and nails are examples of fully keratinized epithelial cells.
Melanocytes: The role of melanocytes in the skin is to produce the pigment melanin, which determines skin coloration.
Langerhans cells: These are dendritic cells involved in antigen processing when the skin becomes infected, they act as antigen-processing cells. They contain large organelles known as Birbeck granules, but the exact function of these is still unknown.
Merkel cells: These act as mechanosensory cells and are involved in touch reception (the ability to feel).
Other types of sensory cells are present within the skin, however are found in the deeper layers and known as cutaneous receptors. ffBone cells

There  are four types of bone cells in the body; osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes and lining cells.

Osteoclasts

Osteoclasts are large multinucleated cells that are involved in bone resorption. This is where the bone is broken down during the process of renewal. Osteoclasts break down bone by forming sealed compartments on its surface, and releasing enzymes and acids. After they complete the process, they die by apoptosis (programmed cell death).
Osteoblasts

Osteoblasts  have the opposite function, they are involved in the generation of new bone. They are cuboidal in shape and have one central nucleus. They work by synthesising protein which forms the organic matrix of the bone. They are triggered to create new bone by hormones such as vitamin D and estrogen, and have specialised receptors on their surfaces  which detect them.
Osteocytes

Osteocytes are cells that are found inside the bone. They have long branched structures protruding from them allowing cell to cell contact and access to the bone’s surface. Osteocytes can sense mechanical strain being placed on the bone, and secrete growth factors which activate bone growth in response.

The oldest cells in the human body are the NEURONS. They do not grow old like the other cells in our body and therefore are not replaced by new cells. They hold the title of longest living cells in the body. While other cells in the body die and regenerate, many neurons remain the same throughout a person's lifetime.

Protect your skin from the sun every day. Whether spending a day at the beach or running errands, sun protection is essential. You can protect your skin by seeking shade, covering up with sun-protective clothing — such as a lightweight and long-sleeved shirt, pants, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses with UV protection — and using sunscreen that is broad-spectrum, SPF 30 (or higher), and water-resistant. You should apply sunscreen every day to all skin that is not covered by clothing. For more effective protection, look for clothing with an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) label.
Apply self-tanner rather than get a tan. Every time you get a tan, you prematurely age your skin. This holds true if you get a tan from the sun, a tanning bed, or other indoor tanning equipment. All emit harmful UV rays that accelerate how quickly your skin ages.
If you smoke, stop. Smoking greatly speeds up how quickly skin ages. It causes wrinkles and a dull, sallow complexion.
Avoid repetitive facial expressions. When you make a facial expression, you contract the underlying muscles. If you repeatedly contract the same muscles for many years, these lines become permanent. Wearing sunglasses can help reduce lines caused by squinting.
Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet. Findings from a few studies suggest that eating plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables may help prevent damage that leads to premature skin aging. Findings from research studies also suggest that a diet containing lots of sugar or other refined carbohydrates can accelerate aging.
Drink less alcohol. Alcohol is rough on the skin. It dehydrates the skin, and in time, damages the skin. This can make us look older.
Exercise most days of the week. Findings from a few studies suggest that moderate exercise can improve circulation and boost the immune system. This, in turn, may give the skin a more-youthful appearance.
Cleanse your skin gently. Scrubbing your skin clean can irritate your skin. Irritating your skin accelerates skin aging. Gentle washing helps to remove pollution, makeup, and other substances without irritating your skin.
Wash your face twice a day and after sweating heavily. Perspiration, especially when wearing a hat or helmet, irritates the skin, so you want to wash your skin as soon as possible after sweating.
Apply a facial moisturizer every day. Moisturizer traps water in our skin, giving it a more youthful appearance.
Stop using skin care products that sting or burn. When your skin burns or stings, it means your skin is irritated. Irritating your skin can make it look older.

Salmon — and other fatty types of fish — contain the greatest amount of omega-3s fatty acids.

Omega-3s are extremely important for the optimal function of your body. They’re linked to improved wellbeing and a lower risk of many serious diseases (1).

Although salmon is mainly prized for its beneficial composition of fatty acids, it also packs a massive amount of other nutrients.

A 100-gram piece of wild salmon contains 2.8 grams of omega-3s, along with lots of high-quality animal protein and ample vitamins and minerals, including large amounts of magnesium, potassium, selenium and B vitamins (2).

It is a good idea to eat fatty fish at least once or twice a week to get all the omega-3s your body needs.

Studies show that people who eat fatty fish regularly have a lower risk of heart disease, dementia, depression and many other common diseases (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6).

Also, salmon tastes good and is fairly simple to prepare. It also tends to make you feel full with relatively few calories.

If you can, choose wild salmon instead of farmed. It is more nutritious, has a better omega-6 to omega-3 ratio and is less likely to contain contaminants (7, 8).

Man, according to the Bible, is 'made in the image and likeness of God.'. . . It is possible for man to become like God, to become deified, to become god by grace.
